# HI! ðŸ‘‹

## Actual Status
I'm a Brazilian beginner programmer with a good understanding of programming concepts, a decent knowledge of Python, and a basic foundation in web development. Currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science, I'm expanding my skills by exploring various programming languages. My focus now is to study and learn to developer in the futere to achieve my dreams, and I'm actually studying about QA Engineering to have knowledge on this area. I'm always eager to learn and improve!
